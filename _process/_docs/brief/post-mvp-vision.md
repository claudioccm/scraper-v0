# Post-MVP Vision

## Phase 2 Features (Post-MVP)
- **MCP Integration:** Model Context Protocol integration enabling LLMs to directly interact with the design system, generate components, and manage themes through standardized protocols
- **LLM Testing Framework:** Automated testing to ensure AI-generated code meets accessibility and quality standards
- **Machine-Readable Schemas:** JSON/YAML component definitions for advanced AI integration
- **Advanced AI Integration:** AI can generate complete branded websites from prompts
- **Full Theme Automation:** AI can customize 100% of visual aspects without touching component code
- **Web Components Architecture:** Framework-agnostic Web Components version allowing usage across React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Multi-Framework Tooling:** Build system that generates framework-specific wrappers and adapters from core Web Components
- **AI Agent Ecosystem:** MCP servers that enable AI agents to browse, generate, and deploy white-label sites autonomously

## Long-term Vision (1-2 Years)
- **Universal Design System:** Single component library that works everywhere - from Vue/React apps to plain HTML sites
- **AI-Native Development:** LLMs as first-class development partners through MCP, not just documentation consumers
- **Framework Independence:** Insulation from JavaScript framework churn through Web Standards-based architecture  
- **Agent Marketplace:** Ecosystem of specialized AI agents for design, content, deployment, and optimization

## Expansion Opportunities
- **Cross-Platform Components:** Native mobile components (iOS/Android) that share design tokens with web
- **Design Tool Integration:** Figma/Sketch plugins that sync with Web Components through MCP
- **Enterprise MCP Services:** Custom AI agents for brand management, compliance checking, and automated deployment
- **Standards Contribution:** Open source contributions to Web Components and MCP specifications

## Strategic Advantages of This Approach
- **Future-Proof:** Web Components will outlast any current JavaScript framework
- **AI-First:** MCP enables true AI collaboration, not just AI assistance
- **Universal Adoption:** Works with any tech stack, removing adoption barriers
- **Ecosystem Scalability:** Other developers can build framework adapters without core system changes
