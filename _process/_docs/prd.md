# White Label Design System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

Based on your project brief, here are the primary desired outcomes:

• **Dramatically reduce time-to-market** for branded websites (from months to weeks)
• **Enable complete visual customization** without compromising underlying architecture  
• **Create LLM-optimized design system** for AI-driven component generation
• **Establish comprehensive design token foundation** supporting white-label theming
• **Build production-ready component library** following atomic design hierarchy
• **Implement content-driven architecture** with theme-aware rendering
• **Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** across all components
• **Generate 1000+ AI-generated implementations** within 12 months through LLM adoption

### Background Context

Your White Label Design System addresses a critical market gap where development agencies and in-house teams repeatedly rebuild design systems from scratch for each brand, wasting 60-80% of development time on foundational work. The system transforms your existing Nuxt3/Vue3 + Nuxt Content repository into a dual-pillar architecture: a themeable design system with complete visual abstraction, and a content engine foundation providing project boilerplate capabilities.

The system uniquely positions itself as "Shadcn for white-label branding" - optimized for LLM consumption and generation while enabling human developers to rapidly deploy branded websites. With your existing HSL color system, CSS layers methodology, and Utopia integration already providing 70% of the foundation, this PRD will complete the strategic framework for full white-label capabilities.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The White Label Design System prioritizes **developer velocity** and **brand flexibility** above all else. The user experience centers on rapid customization workflows where agencies can transform a base design system into a fully branded website in under 30 minutes. The interface paradigm emphasizes **"configuration over coding"** - users should achieve complete visual customization through design token editing rather than component modification. The system provides **progressive disclosure** of complexity, starting with simple theme variables and advancing to granular token control for power users.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Theme-First Workflow:** Users begin with theme selection/creation rather than component assembly, establishing the visual foundation before content structuring.

**Live Preview System:** All theme modifications provide real-time feedback across component examples, eliminating guesswork in brand customization.

**Token-Based Customization:** Visual changes happen through semantic design token manipulation (primary color, typography scale, spacing rhythm) rather than CSS editing.

**LLM-Assisted Development:** The system provides structured prompts and component schemas enabling AI agents to generate, customize, and deploy branded components autonomously.

**Progressive Component Revelation:** Atomic design hierarchy guides users from simple atoms to complex organisms, with clear dependency relationships and usage contexts.

### Core Screens and Views

**Theme Configuration Dashboard** - Central hub for selecting base themes, customizing design tokens, and previewing changes across component library

**Component Library Browser** - Searchable catalog of all components with live examples, code snippets, and LLM-optimized documentation

**Project Scaffolding Interface** - One-command setup flow that combines theme selection with content template choices for rapid project initialization

**Brand Asset Manager** - Upload and management interface for logos, fonts, images, and other brand-specific assets with automatic optimization

**Content Template Gallery** - Pre-built page templates (homepage, about, blog) with theme-aware previews and customization options

**Developer Documentation Portal** - LLM-optimized documentation with prompt templates, usage examples, and integration guides

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

All interface elements must achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum, with AAA targets for high-contrast modes. The system includes automated accessibility testing in the design token validation pipeline, ensuring theme customizations maintain contrast ratios and usability standards. Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation patterns are built into every component by default.

### Branding

The system itself maintains a **minimal, developer-focused aesthetic** that doesn't compete with the brands it enables. Interface design emphasizes **clarity, efficiency, and professional credibility** using a neutral color palette that allows customized themes to shine. Visual hierarchy prioritizes **content over chrome** with generous whitespace and clear typography scales that demonstrate the system's own design token implementation.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on **desktop-first responsive design** optimizing for developer workflows on larger screens while maintaining full mobile compatibility. The theme configuration interface adapts gracefully to tablet and mobile viewports for stakeholder reviews and approvals. Generated branded sites support full responsive behavior across all device categories with fluid typography and spacing scales.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The White Label Design System will maintain a **monorepo structure** containing the design system library, documentation, tooling, and example implementations. This approach enables:
- **Unified versioning** across design tokens, components, and documentation
- **Simplified dependency management** for LLM-generated code examples
- **Integrated testing** of design token changes across all components
- **Single source of truth** for brand theme definitions and component schemas

**Rationale:** Given the tight coupling between design tokens, components, and documentation required for LLM optimization, a monorepo eliminates synchronization issues and enables atomic updates across the entire system.

### Service Architecture

**Design System Distribution Architecture:** The system follows a **hybrid static/runtime approach** where:
- **Design tokens** are distributed as static CSS custom property files per theme
- **Component library** is distributed as ES modules with framework adapters
- **Documentation system** runs as a static site generator with live preview capabilities
- **Theme generation tools** operate as build-time utilities with optional runtime switching

This architecture supports both **build-time optimization** for production sites and **runtime flexibility** for theme preview and customization workflows.

**Rationale:** This hybrid approach balances performance (static generation) with developer experience (runtime preview) while maintaining LLM compatibility through predictable, stateless component APIs.

### Testing Requirements

**Comprehensive Testing Pyramid:** The system requires full testing coverage across multiple dimensions:

**Unit Testing:**
- Component behavior and prop validation
