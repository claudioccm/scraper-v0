# Recommendations

## Immediate Actions:
1. **Validate Performance Targets:** Create prototype theme switching to validate 100ms target
2. **LLM Technical Spike:** Early validation of schema generation and AI prompt effectiveness
3. **Bundle Size Analysis:** Estimate component library size to validate 50KB constraint

## Implementation Guidance:
1. **Start with Epic 1 immediately** - Design token foundation is well-defined and builds on existing work
2. **Prototype LLM features early** in Epic 2 to validate technical approach
3. **Performance monitoring from Day 1** to ensure targets remain achievable

## Long-term Considerations:
1. **Community Feedback Loop:** Plan for user feedback on LLM effectiveness and developer experience
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Establish baseline measurements early in Epic 1
3. **Scalability Planning:** Monitor complexity as component library grows
