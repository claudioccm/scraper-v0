# Epic 2: Core Atomic Component Library

**Epic Goal:** Build the complete atomic design component library (30+ components) following the ccm-* naming convention with full LLM optimization, accessibility compliance, and machine-readable schemas. This epic delivers a production-ready component library that leverages the design token foundation from Epic 1, providing developers with a comprehensive set of themed components while establishing the patterns and documentation structure that will guide LLM code generation.

## Story 2.1: Typography Component System (ccmText, ccmHeading)

As a content creator using the design system,
I want semantic typography components that automatically apply correct styling and accessibility attributes,
so that I can create consistent, accessible text content without memorizing CSS classes or token names.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **ccmText Component:** Flexible text component supporting semantic variants (body, caption, label, small) with proper HTML element selection
2. **ccmHeading Component:** Heading component with semantic levels (h1-h6) that maintain visual hierarchy while allowing logical document structure
3. **Typography Token Integration:** Components use semantic typography tokens with automatic responsive scaling via Utopia
4. **Accessibility Implementation:** Proper heading hierarchy, screen reader compatibility, and WCAG AA compliance
5. **LLM Schema Generation:** Machine-readable component schemas with usage examples and prop documentation

## Story 2.2: Layout Foundation Components (ccmGrid, ccmStack, ccmCluster)

As a developer building page layouts,
I want foundational layout components that handle common spacing and arrangement patterns,
so that I can create consistent, responsive layouts without writing custom CSS for every arrangement.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **ccmGrid Component:** Flexible grid system supporting responsive columns with integrated design token spacing
2. **ccmStack Component:** Vertical stacking layout with consistent spacing using semantic spacing tokens
3. **ccmCluster Component:** Horizontal clustering with wrapping behavior and consistent gaps
4. **Responsive Behavior:** All layout components adapt properly to viewport changes using Utopia fluid scaling
5. **Composition Compatibility:** Layout components work together seamlessly for complex arrangements

## Story 2.3: Core Interactive Components (ccmButton Enhancement, ccmInput, ccmSelect)

As a user interacting with form elements and navigation,
I want interactive components that provide clear feedback and maintain accessibility standards,
so that I can confidently interact with interfaces regardless of theme or device capabilities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **ccmButton Enhancement:** Existing button component fully integrated with component design tokens and accessibility improvements
2. **ccmInput Component:** Text input with label association, validation states, and proper ARIA attributes
3. **ccmSelect Component:** Dropdown select with keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
4. **Interactive States:** All components support focus, hover, active, and disabled states with appropriate visual feedback
5. **Form Integration:** Components work together seamlessly for complete form experiences

## Story 2.4: Content Display Components (ccmCard Enhancement, ccmBadge, ccmAlert)

As a content manager displaying information,
I want components that present content in structured, visually appealing ways,
so that users can easily scan and understand information hierarchy and importance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **ccmCard Enhancement:** Existing card component fully themed with design tokens and improved content flexibility
2. **ccmBadge Component:** Small status indicators supporting semantic color variants (success, warning, error, info)
3. **ccmAlert Component:** Notification component with semantic variants and dismissible functionality
4. **Content Flexibility:** Components support various content types (text, images, actions) with proper spacing
5. **Visual Hierarchy:** Components establish clear information hierarchy using typography and spacing tokens

## Story 2.5: Navigation Components (ccmNavigation Enhancement, ccmBreadcrumb, ccmPagination)

As a user navigating through content,
I want navigation components that provide clear wayfinding and accessibility,
so that I can understand my location and easily move between related content.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **ccmNavigation Enhancement:** Existing navigation component with full theme integration and mobile responsiveness
2. **ccmBreadcrumb Component:** Hierarchical navigation with proper semantic markup and current page indication
3. **ccmPagination Component:** Page navigation with accessible controls and clear current state indication
4. **Keyboard Navigation:** All navigation components fully accessible via keyboard with logical tab order
5. **Mobile Adaptation:** Navigation components adapt appropriately for mobile viewports and touch interaction

## Story 2.6: Component Documentation & LLM Optimization

As an AI agent generating code using this design system,
I want comprehensive, machine-readable component documentation with standardized schemas and usage examples,
so that I can accurately generate working components and understand proper implementation patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Standardized Documentation:** All components follow documentation standards template with consistent structure
2. **Machine-Readable Schemas:** JSON schemas generated for each component with complete prop and slot definitions
3. **Usage Examples:** Multiple usage examples per component covering common patterns and edge cases
4. **LLM Prompt Templates:** Template prompts for AI agents to generate each component type with proper configuration
5. **Integration Testing:** Automated tests validate that LLM-generated code using schemas produces working components

## Story 2.7: Component Library Integration & Testing

As a developer integrating the component library,
I want comprehensive testing coverage and clear integration patterns,
so that I can confidently use components in production applications and extend the library when needed.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Unit Test Coverage:** Complete test coverage for all components including prop variations and accessibility compliance
2. **Integration Tests:** Tests validate component interaction and theme responsiveness across all components
3. **Accessibility Validation:** Automated accessibility testing ensures WCAG AA compliance for all components
4. **Performance Testing:** Bundle size analysis and tree-shaking validation for individual component imports
5. **Developer Experience:** Clear integration documentation and troubleshooting guides for common issues
