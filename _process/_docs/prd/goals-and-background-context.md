# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Based on your project brief, here are the primary desired outcomes:

• **Dramatically reduce time-to-market** for branded websites (from months to weeks)
• **Enable complete visual customization** without compromising underlying architecture  
• **Create LLM-optimized design system** for AI-driven component generation
• **Establish comprehensive design token foundation** supporting white-label theming
• **Build production-ready component library** following atomic design hierarchy
• **Implement content-driven architecture** with theme-aware rendering
• **Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** across all components
• **Generate 1000+ AI-generated implementations** within 12 months through LLM adoption

## Background Context

Your White Label Design System addresses a critical market gap where development agencies and in-house teams repeatedly rebuild design systems from scratch for each brand, wasting 60-80% of development time on foundational work. The system transforms your existing Nuxt3/Vue3 + Nuxt Content repository into a dual-pillar architecture: a themeable design system with complete visual abstraction, and a content engine foundation providing project boilerplate capabilities.

The system uniquely positions itself as "Shadcn for white-label branding" - optimized for LLM consumption and generation while enabling human developers to rapidly deploy branded websites. With your existing HSL color system, CSS layers methodology, and Utopia integration already providing 70% of the foundation, this PRD will complete the strategic framework for full white-label capabilities.
