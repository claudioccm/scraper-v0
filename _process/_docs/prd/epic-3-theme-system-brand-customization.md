# Epic 3: Theme System & Brand Customization

**Epic Goal:** Implement the complete theme customization system with dynamic theme switching, brand asset management, and the theme configuration dashboard. This epic delivers the core white-label functionality that enables agencies to rapidly customize the visual appearance of their projects through design token manipulation, brand asset integration, and real-time preview capabilities, transforming the component library from Epic 2 into a fully brandable system.

## Story 3.1: Advanced Theme Configuration Interface

As a brand manager customizing a website theme,
I want an intuitive interface for modifying design tokens with real-time preview,
so that I can create branded experiences without technical knowledge or developer assistance.

2. **Real-Time Preview:** All token changes immediately reflected in component preview area without page refresh
3. **Color Picker Integration:** Visual color selection tools that automatically generate HSL values and validate contrast ratios
4. **Typography Controls:** Interface for selecting fonts, adjusting scales, and configuring semantic typography relationships
5. **Validation Feedback:** Real-time warnings for accessibility violations (contrast ratios, touch targets) and missing token values

## Story 3.2: Brand Asset Management System

As a brand manager maintaining visual consistency,
I want to upload, organize, and manage brand assets (logos, fonts, images),
so that themed projects automatically use correct brand materials and maintain visual consistency.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Asset Upload Interface:** File upload system supporting logos, custom fonts, images, and other brand assets
2. **Asset Organization:** Categorized storage system with search, tagging, and organization capabilities
3. **Font Integration:** Custom font upload with automatic @font-face generation and design token integration
4. **Image Optimization:** Automatic image processing for multiple formats (WebP, AVIF) and responsive sizes
5. **Asset Preview:** Visual preview system showing how assets appear within themed components

## Story 3.3: Multi-Theme Management & Switching

As an agency managing multiple client brands,
I want to create, save, and switch between multiple complete brand themes,
so that I can efficiently manage different client projects and compare visual treatments.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Theme Creation Workflow:** Interface for creating new themes from scratch or duplicating existing themes
2. **Theme Library Management:** Organized storage system for named themes with preview thumbnails and metadata
3. **Theme Import/Export:** Ability to export themes as files and import themes from other projects or team members
4. **Runtime Theme Switching:** Seamless switching between themes with proper asset loading and cache management
5. **Theme Validation:** System checks for theme completeness and provides warnings about missing assets or token values

## Story 3.4: Advanced Preview & Testing System

As a designer validating theme customizations,
I want comprehensive preview capabilities across different content types and device sizes,
so that I can ensure the themed design works correctly in all usage scenarios before deployment.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Multi-Viewport Preview:** Simultaneous preview across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports with accurate responsive behavior
2. **Content Type Testing:** Preview system includes various content scenarios (long text, images, forms, navigation) to validate theme robustness
3. **Component Interaction Testing:** Preview includes interactive states (hover, focus, active) and form functionality validation
4. **Accessibility Preview:** High contrast mode, screen reader simulation, and keyboard navigation testing within preview
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time performance metrics (bundle size, paint times) for theme customizations

## Story 3.5: Theme Generation & Export Pipeline

As a developer deploying a themed project,
I want automated theme compilation that generates optimized assets and deployment-ready files,
so that themed projects can be efficiently deployed with minimal manual processing.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **CSS Bundle Generation:** Automated compilation of theme-specific CSS files with optimized custom property definitions
2. **Asset Pipeline Integration:** Automatic processing and optimization of brand assets for production deployment
3. **Build Tool Integration:** Seamless integration with existing Nuxt build process for theme compilation during development and production builds
4. **Critical CSS Extraction:** Automatic identification and extraction of critical CSS for improved loading performance
5. **Deployment Package Creation:** Generation of complete deployment packages including all theme assets and configuration files

## Story 3.6: Developer Theme API & Integration

As a developer integrating custom themes into applications,
I want programmatic APIs for theme management and customization,
so that I can build custom theme interfaces or integrate theme functionality into existing tools and workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Theme Configuration API:** JavaScript/TypeScript API for programmatically reading, modifying, and applying theme configurations
2. **Theme Event System:** Event listeners for theme changes, validation errors, and asset loading states
3. **Custom Integration Hooks:** Composable functions for Vue applications to integrate theme functionality into custom interfaces
4. **Theme Validation Utilities:** Programmatic validation functions for theme completeness, accessibility compliance, and token relationships
5. **Developer Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation with examples for custom theme integration scenarios

## Story 3.7: Theme System Testing & Performance Optimization

As a system architect ensuring production readiness,
I want comprehensive testing coverage and performance optimization for the theme system,
so that theme switching is reliable, fast, and doesn't degrade user experience in production applications.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Theme Switching Performance:** Automated tests ensuring theme changes complete within 100ms without layout thrashing
2. **Memory Management:** Tests validate proper cleanup of unused theme assets and prevent memory leaks during theme switching
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Theme system tested across major browsers with fallbacks for unsupported features
4. **Load Testing:** Performance validation with complex themes, large asset sets, and multiple simultaneous theme operations
5. **Error Recovery:** Robust error handling for corrupted themes, missing assets, and network failures during theme operations
