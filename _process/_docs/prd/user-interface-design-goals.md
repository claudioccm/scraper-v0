# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The White Label Design System prioritizes **developer velocity** and **brand flexibility** above all else. The user experience centers on rapid customization workflows where agencies can transform a base design system into a fully branded website in under 30 minutes. The interface paradigm emphasizes **"configuration over coding"** - users should achieve complete visual customization through design token editing rather than component modification. The system provides **progressive disclosure** of complexity, starting with simple theme variables and advancing to granular token control for power users.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Theme-First Workflow:** Users begin with theme selection/creation rather than component assembly, establishing the visual foundation before content structuring.

**Live Preview System:** All theme modifications provide real-time feedback across component examples, eliminating guesswork in brand customization.

**Token-Based Customization:** Visual changes happen through semantic design token manipulation (primary color, typography scale, spacing rhythm) rather than CSS editing.

**LLM-Assisted Development:** The system provides structured prompts and component schemas enabling AI agents to generate, customize, and deploy branded components autonomously.

**Progressive Component Revelation:** Atomic design hierarchy guides users from simple atoms to complex organisms, with clear dependency relationships and usage contexts.

## Core Screens and Views

**Theme Configuration Dashboard** - Central hub for selecting base themes, customizing design tokens, and previewing changes across component library

**Component Library Browser** - Searchable catalog of all components with live examples, code snippets, and LLM-optimized documentation

**Project Scaffolding Interface** - One-command setup flow that combines theme selection with content template choices for rapid project initialization

**Brand Asset Manager** - Upload and management interface for logos, fonts, images, and other brand-specific assets with automatic optimization

**Content Template Gallery** - Pre-built page templates (homepage, about, blog) with theme-aware previews and customization options

**Developer Documentation Portal** - LLM-optimized documentation with prompt templates, usage examples, and integration guides

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

All interface elements must achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum, with AAA targets for high-contrast modes. The system includes automated accessibility testing in the design token validation pipeline, ensuring theme customizations maintain contrast ratios and usability standards. Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation patterns are built into every component by default.

## Branding

The system itself maintains a **minimal, developer-focused aesthetic** that doesn't compete with the brands it enables. Interface design emphasizes **clarity, efficiency, and professional credibility** using a neutral color palette that allows customized themes to shine. Visual hierarchy prioritizes **content over chrome** with generous whitespace and clear typography scales that demonstrate the system's own design token implementation.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on **desktop-first responsive design** optimizing for developer workflows on larger screens while maintaining full mobile compatibility. The theme configuration interface adapts gracefully to tablet and mobile viewports for stakeholder reviews and approvals. Generated branded sites support full responsive behavior across all device categories with fluid typography and spacing scales.
