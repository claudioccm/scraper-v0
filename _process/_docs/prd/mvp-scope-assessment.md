# MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Assessment:** âœ… **Appropriate for MVP**
- **Well-balanced:** Each epic delivers incremental, deployable value
- **Foundation-first approach:** Design tokens and components before advanced features
- **Clear progression:** Each epic builds logically on previous work
- **Market-ready:** Delivers core white-label functionality without feature bloat

**No features should be cut** - the scope represents genuine MVP functionality for white-label design system market entry.
