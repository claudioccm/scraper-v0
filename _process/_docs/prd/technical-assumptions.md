# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The White Label Design System will maintain a **monorepo structure** containing the design system library, documentation, tooling, and example implementations. This approach enables:
- **Unified versioning** across design tokens, components, and documentation
- **Simplified dependency management** for LLM-generated code examples
- **Integrated testing** of design token changes across all components
- **Single source of truth** for brand theme definitions and component schemas

**Rationale:** Given the tight coupling between design tokens, components, and documentation required for LLM optimization, a monorepo eliminates synchronization issues and enables atomic updates across the entire system.

## Service Architecture

**Design System Distribution Architecture:** The system follows a **hybrid static/runtime approach** where:
- **Design tokens** are distributed as static CSS custom property files per theme
- **Component library** is distributed as ES modules with framework adapters
- **Documentation system** runs as a static site generator with live preview capabilities
- **Theme generation tools** operate as build-time utilities with optional runtime switching

This architecture supports both **build-time optimization** for production sites and **runtime flexibility** for theme preview and customization workflows.

**Rationale:** This hybrid approach balances performance (static generation) with developer experience (runtime preview) while maintaining LLM compatibility through predictable, stateless component APIs.

## Testing Requirements

**Comprehensive Testing Pyramid:** The system requires full testing coverage across multiple dimensions:

**Unit Testing:**
- Component behavior and prop validation
- Design token computation and inheritance
- Theme switching functionality
- LLM schema generation accuracy

**Integration Testing:**
- Component interaction within layouts
- Theme consistency across component combinations
- Build system integration with theme generation
- Documentation site functionality

**End-to-End Testing:**
- Complete theme customization workflows
- Project scaffolding and deployment pipelines
- LLM-generated component validation
- Accessibility compliance verification across themes

**LLM Validation Testing:**
- Automated testing of AI-generated component implementations
- Schema accuracy validation against actual component APIs
- Prompt template effectiveness measurement

**Rationale:** Given the system's complexity (design tokens + components + LLM optimization) and quality requirements (professional design system), comprehensive testing is essential to prevent regressions and ensure LLM-generated code works correctly.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Framework Constraints:**
- **Nuxt 3.16.2+ with Vue 3.5.13+** - Maintain compatibility with existing composition API patterns and auto-import system
- **TypeScript-first development** - All component APIs and design token schemas must have complete type definitions
- **PostCSS + CSS Layers** - Continue using established CSS architecture without introducing CSS-in-JS dependencies

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Tree-shaking support** - Individual components must be importable without full system dependencies
- **Critical CSS extraction** - Theme-specific critical CSS must be extractable for optimal loading performance
- **Bundle size constraints** - Base component library must remain under 50KB gzipped

**LLM Integration Constraints:**
- **Schema standardization** - All component definitions must follow consistent JSON Schema format for LLM consumption
- **Prompt template validation** - All LLM prompt templates must be tested against actual AI agents for accuracy
- **Documentation structure** - LLM-optimized documentation must follow established format for maximum AI comprehension

**Accessibility Infrastructure:**
- **Automated contrast checking** - Design token validation must include automated color contrast verification
- **Screen reader testing integration** - Component testing pipeline must include automated screen reader compatibility checks
- **Keyboard navigation validation** - All interactive components must pass automated keyboard accessibility tests

**Build System Requirements:**
- **Theme compilation pipeline** - Automated build process for generating theme-specific CSS bundles from design tokens
- **Component registry generation** - Automated creation of searchable component index for LLM discovery
- **Documentation site generation** - Integrated build process for creating searchable, LLM-optimized documentation
