# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall provide a complete atomic design component hierarchy with 30+ production-ready components (atoms, molecules, organisms) following ccm-* naming conventions

**FR2:** The system shall implement a three-tier design token architecture (primitive → semantic → component) enabling complete visual customization without touching component logic

**FR3:** The system shall support dynamic theme switching via CSS custom property cascading, allowing multiple branded instances from a single codebase

**FR4:** The system shall generate machine-readable component schemas (JSON/YAML) optimized for LLM consumption and code generation

**FR5:** The system shall provide one-command project scaffolding that creates new themed projects with complete content structure in under 30 minutes

**FR6:** The system shall implement theme-aware content rendering where markdown content automatically adapts to the active brand theme

**FR7:** The system shall support HSL-based color system with automated tint/shade generation and semantic color aliases (success, warning, error, info)

**FR8:** The system shall integrate Utopia.fyi fluid typography and spacing scales with semantic aliases for consistent responsive behavior

**FR9:** The system shall provide comprehensive LLM-optimized documentation with prompt templates, usage examples, and AI guidance notes for each component

**FR10:** The system shall implement a content template library with pre-built page templates (homepage, about, blog, portfolio) that work across all themes

**FR11:** The system shall support related content functionality with composable functions for tag/category-based content relationships and discovery

**FR12:** The system shall provide brand-specific content variants allowing customized copy and messaging per theme

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** All components must achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and 4.5:1 color contrast ratios

**NFR2:** Generated sites must achieve 90+ Lighthouse performance scores across all Core Web Vitals metrics

**NFR3:** The design token system must support real-time theme switching without page refresh or layout shift

**NFR4:** Component documentation must be structured for 90%+ LLM generation accuracy using standardized schemas and prompt templates

**NFR5:** The CSS architecture must maintain predictable cascade control through layer methodology without requiring !important declarations

**NFR6:** All design tokens must follow semantic naming conventions enabling automated theme generation and validation

**NFR7:** Component bundle sizes must support tree-shaking with individual components loadable without full system dependencies

**NFR8:** The system must maintain backward compatibility with existing Nuxt 3 auto-import and composition API patterns

**NFR9:** Theme customization must be achievable through CSS custom property editing without requiring build process modifications

**NFR10:** The system must support progressive enhancement ensuring functionality without JavaScript while optimizing for modern browser capabilities
