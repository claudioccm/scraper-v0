# Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**

This PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The epic structure provides clear sequential value delivery, technical constraints are well-defined, and the scope appropriately balances ambition with MVP practicality.

**Key Strengths:**
- Leverages existing technical foundation intelligently
- Clear market differentiation through LLM integration
- Well-sequenced epic structure with incremental value delivery
- Comprehensive requirements with testable acceptance criteria

The architect can proceed immediately with Epic 1 (Design Token Foundation) implementation while validating performance and LLM integration assumptions during early development phases.
