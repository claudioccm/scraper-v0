# Epic 1: Design Token Foundation & Component Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the complete three-tier design token architecture (primitive → semantic → component) integrated with your existing CSS layers system, while building the foundational component infrastructure. This epic delivers a working theme preview interface that demonstrates real-time design token changes across a basic component library, providing immediate value for developers and validating the entire theming approach before scaling to the full component system.

## Story 1.1: Design Token File Structure & Migration

As a developer setting up the White Label Design System,
I want the existing color and spacing tokens reorganized into a clear three-tier hierarchy,
so that I have a solid foundation for building themed components and can easily understand token relationships.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **File Structure Created:** New `/public/css/tokens/` directory structure exists with `primitives/`, `semantic/`, and `component/` subdirectories
2. **Primitive Tokens Migrated:** All HSL color values and Utopia spacing scales are extracted to primitive token files with consistent naming
3. **Import Chain Updated:** Main `styles.css` imports new token structure maintaining existing layer cascade order
4. **Existing Functionality Preserved:** All current components continue to work without visual changes during migration
5. **Token Hierarchy Validated:** Primitive tokens contain only raw values, no cross-references to other tokens

## Story 1.2: Semantic Token Layer Implementation

As a theme customizer,
I want semantic design tokens that create meaningful relationships between primitive values and component usage,
so that I can make brand-level changes (like "primary color") without understanding the technical color system.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Brand Color Assignment:** Semantic tokens map brand concepts (primary, secondary, accent) to primitive HSL values
2. **System Color Implementation:** Success, warning, error, info colors are semantically defined with proper contrast relationships
3. **Surface Color System:** Background, foreground, and surface color relationships are established with accessibility compliance
4. **Typography Semantic Aliases:** Utopia font scales are mapped to semantic roles (heading-1, heading-2, body-text, caption)
5. **Spacing Semantic Aliases:** Utopia spacing scales are mapped to layout roles (gutter, section-gap, component-gap)
6. **Token Documentation:** Each semantic token includes clear usage guidance and relationship to primitives

## Story 1.3: Component Token Architecture

As a component developer,
I want component-specific design tokens that create a clean API for theming individual components,
so that I can build components that automatically respond to theme changes without hardcoded values.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Component Token Files:** Individual token files created for button, card, and form components with component-specific variables
2. **Token Inheritance:** Component tokens properly reference semantic tokens rather than primitive values directly
3. **Component Integration:** Existing ccmButton component updated to use component tokens via CSS custom properties
4. **Theme Responsiveness:** Component tokens automatically inherit theme changes when semantic tokens are modified
5. **Token Isolation:** Component-specific tokens are scoped to avoid naming conflicts with other components

## Story 1.4: Theme Switching Infrastructure

As a brand manager testing theme customization,
I want the ability to switch between different brand themes at runtime,
so that I can preview and compare different visual treatments without rebuilding the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Theme CSS Generation:** System generates theme-specific CSS files with semantic token overrides
2. **Runtime Theme Switching:** JavaScript utility enables switching themes by updating CSS custom properties
3. **Theme Persistence:** Selected theme persists across page reloads using localStorage
4. **Default Theme Structure:** Complete default theme file demonstrates all semantic token assignments
5. **Theme Validation:** System validates theme completeness and warns about missing token definitions

## Story 1.5: Basic Theme Preview Interface

As a developer validating the token system,
I want a simple interface that demonstrates theme switching across basic components,
so that I can validate the design token architecture works correctly and provides immediate visual feedback.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Component Preview Grid:** Interface displays button, card, and typography samples in a responsive grid
2. **Live Theme Switcher:** Dropdown or toggle interface allows real-time switching between available themes
3. **Token Inspector:** Debug panel shows current token values for transparency and troubleshooting
4. **Responsive Preview:** Interface works correctly across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
5. **Visual Validation:** Theme changes are immediately visible across all preview components without page refresh

## Story 1.6: Foundation Testing & Documentation

As a system architect ensuring quality,
I want comprehensive testing and documentation for the token foundation,
so that the system is reliable and other developers can understand and extend the token architecture.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Token Validation Tests:** Automated tests verify token hierarchy relationships and catch circular references
2. **Accessibility Testing:** Automated tests ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards across all themes
3. **Integration Tests:** Tests validate that theme switching maintains component functionality
4. **Architecture Documentation:** Clear documentation explains token hierarchy, naming conventions, and extension patterns
5. **Migration Guide:** Documentation provides step-by-step guide for adding new tokens and creating custom themes
