# Top Issues by Priority

## BLOCKERS: None identified

## HIGH Priority:
1. **LLM Integration Technical Validation:** Schema generation and AI prompt effectiveness need technical validation with actual AI agents during implementation
2. **Performance Target Validation:** 90+ Lighthouse scores and 100ms theme switching may need adjustment based on system complexity

## MEDIUM Priority:
1. **Bundle Size Constraint:** 50KB gzipped target for component library may be challenging with 30+ components
2. **30-minute Project Setup:** Time target may be optimistic depending on theme complexity

## LOW Priority:
1. **LLM Accuracy Target:** 90% generation accuracy needs definition of measurement methodology
