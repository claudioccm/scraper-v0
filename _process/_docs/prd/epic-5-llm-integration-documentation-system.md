# Epic 5: LLM Integration & Documentation System

**Epic Goal:** Build comprehensive LLM-optimized documentation, component schemas, prompt templates, and AI-assisted development workflows that transform the White Label Design System into a fully AI-compatible platform. This epic delivers the critical differentiator that enables AI agents to understand, generate, and deploy branded components autonomously, positioning the system as the premier choice for LLM-driven development workflows.

## Story 5.1: Comprehensive Component Schema Generation

As an AI agent needing to generate components using this design system,
I want machine-readable schemas that precisely define component APIs, props, and usage patterns,
so that I can generate syntactically correct and functionally complete components without human intervention.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **JSON Schema Generation:** Automated generation of complete JSON schemas for all components with prop types, validation rules, and default values
2. **Schema Validation Pipeline:** Automated testing that validates schemas against actual component implementations to prevent drift
3. **Dependency Mapping:** Schemas include component dependencies, required imports, and integration requirements
4. **Usage Context Definition:** Schemas specify appropriate usage contexts, component combinations, and layout constraints
5. **Version Management:** Schema versioning system that tracks component API changes and maintains backward compatibility information

## Story 5.2: LLM-Optimized Documentation Architecture

As an AI agent researching component usage patterns,
I want documentation structured for optimal machine parsing with consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage,
so that I can quickly understand component capabilities and generate appropriate implementations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Standardized Documentation Format:** All component documentation follows LLM-optimized template with consistent structure and metadata
2. **Machine-Parseable Examples:** Code examples with structured metadata indicating usage patterns, complexity levels, and theme compatibility
3. **Context-Rich Descriptions:** Component descriptions include semantic purpose, visual impact, and interaction behaviors for AI understanding
4. **Cross-Reference System:** Comprehensive linking between related components, design tokens, and usage patterns
5. **Documentation Validation:** Automated testing ensures all code examples work correctly and documentation stays current

## Story 5.3: AI Prompt Template Library

As an AI agent generating themed components,
I want pre-built prompt templates that guide component generation with proper design token usage and theme integration,
so that I can generate components that automatically work with the white-label theming system.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Component Generation Prompts:** Template prompts for generating each component type with proper theme integration and accessibility requirements
2. **Theme Customization Prompts:** Prompts for modifying existing components to work with new themes or brand requirements
3. **Layout Composition Prompts:** Templates for combining components into common layout patterns and page structures
4. **Troubleshooting Prompts:** Diagnostic prompts for AI agents to identify and fix common integration issues
5. **Prompt Validation System:** Testing framework that validates prompt effectiveness with actual AI agents and measures generation accuracy

## Story 5.4: AI-Assisted Component Customization

As a developer working with AI to customize components,
I want AI workflows that can intelligently modify components for specific brand requirements while maintaining system compatibility,
so that I can rapidly create brand-specific variations without manual theme development.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Brand Analysis Workflow:** AI system that analyzes brand assets and suggests appropriate design token modifications
2. **Component Variation Generation:** AI workflows for creating component variants (sizes, styles, behaviors) based on brand requirements
3. **Accessibility Validation:** AI-powered accessibility checking that ensures generated variations maintain WCAG compliance
4. **Integration Testing:** Automated validation that AI-generated customizations work correctly with existing theme system
5. **Human Review Interface:** Clear interface for reviewing and approving AI-generated component modifications

## Story 5.5: Automated Documentation Generation

As a system maintainer keeping documentation current,
I want automated documentation generation that extracts component information from code and maintains accurate, up-to-date documentation,
so that LLM agents always have access to current component information without manual documentation maintenance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Code Analysis Pipeline:** Automated extraction of component props, methods, events, and slots from Vue component files
2. **Usage Pattern Detection:** Analysis of existing codebase to identify and document common component usage patterns
3. **Example Generation:** Automated creation of usage examples based on component API and existing implementation patterns
4. **Documentation Synchronization:** Build process ensures documentation updates automatically when component code changes
5. **Quality Metrics:** Automated measurement of documentation completeness and AI-friendliness with improvement recommendations

## Story 5.6: LLM Testing & Validation Framework

As a system architect ensuring AI compatibility,
I want comprehensive testing that validates LLM-generated code works correctly with the design system,
so that AI agents can confidently generate production-ready components without human verification.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AI Generation Testing:** Automated tests that use actual LLM APIs to generate components and validate functional correctness
2. **Theme Compatibility Testing:** Validation that AI-generated components work correctly across all available themes
3. **Accessibility Compliance Testing:** Automated accessibility testing of LLM-generated components to ensure WCAG compliance
4. **Integration Testing:** Tests validate that AI-generated components integrate properly with existing content and layout systems
5. **Performance Impact Testing:** Measurement and validation of performance impact from AI-generated component variations

## Story 5.7: Developer-AI Collaboration Tools

As a developer collaborating with AI agents on component development,
I want tools that facilitate efficient human-AI collaboration with clear handoffs and quality control,
so that I can leverage AI assistance while maintaining code quality and system consistency.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AI Code Review System:** Tools for reviewing AI-generated code with system-specific validation and improvement suggestions
2. **Collaboration Workflows:** Defined workflows for AI-assisted component development with clear human approval points
3. **Knowledge Transfer Tools:** System for capturing and sharing successful AI collaboration patterns and prompt refinements
4. **Quality Assurance Dashboard:** Interface showing AI generation success rates, common issues, and system improvement opportunities
5. **Developer Training Materials:** Documentation and examples for developers to effectively collaborate with AI agents using the system
