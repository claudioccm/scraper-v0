# The Container (Inferred)

**Note:** The official documentation for The Container is part of the paid version of Every Layout. This documentation is inferred from common web development practices for creating a basic container component.

## The problem

You need a consistent way to constrain the width of your content on large screens and provide a standard amount of horizontal padding on smaller screens. This is a fundamental requirement for most websites to ensure readability and a clean layout.

## The Inferred Solution

The Container component is a simple but essential layout primitive. Its primary job is to wrap a section of content, apply a `max-width`, center it horizontally, and provide consistent horizontal padding.

### Example CSS

A typical implementation of a Container component would look something like this:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 1200px; /* Or your preferred max-width */
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  padding-left: 1rem;
  padding-right: 1rem;
}
```

### How It Works

1.  **`max-width`**: This is the key property. It prevents the container from becoming too wide on large screens, which can make text difficult to read. The value (`1200px` in the example) can be adjusted to suit your design.
2.  **`margin-left: auto` and `margin-right: auto`**: This is a classic CSS technique for horizontally centering a block-level element that has a defined width or max-width.
3.  **`padding-left` and `padding-right`**: These properties ensure that the content within the container has some breathing room on smaller screens, preventing it from touching the edges of the viewport.

### Composition

The Container component is often used as a direct child of the `<body>` or a main layout element, and it typically contains other layout primitives from the Every Layout system, such as the Stack, Grid, or Sidebar.

## Use Cases

The Container component is a versatile and fundamental building block for any layout. It's used for:

*   **Page Layouts:** Wrapping the main content of a page to provide a consistent width and padding.
*   **Section Layouts:** Containing individual sections of a page to give them a uniform appearance.
*   **Component Layouts:** Providing a consistent container for complex components like headers, footers, and feature sections.
