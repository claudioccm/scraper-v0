## Frontend

Nuxt + Vue JS Interface components by ShadCN vue

## Server

Ideally Netlify/Vercel, but if you see the need for a proper server, like a Digital Ocean Droplet,
we can do it.

## Database

ideally something like Supabase, but we could also SQLite, mySQL, Postgres, etc. I'd like to
simplify the stack wherever it makes sense. We should try to use localstorage for offline mode, and
sync it with the DB when user goes online.
