## ‚ùå Known Issues

### Critical
- **In-memory storage**: Cards lost on server restart (needs database migration)
- **No authentication**: All endpoints publicly accessible
- **RSS scheduler disabled by default**: Must manually enable

### High
- **No error recovery**: Failed scrapes not retried
- **Limited error handling**: Some edge cases not covered
- **No input validation**: API accepts potentially invalid data
- **Memory leaks possible**: Large HTML pages stored in memory

### Medium
- **No pagination**: All cards loaded at once (performance issue with many cards)
- **No search**: Can't search cards by content
- **No cleanup**: Old cache entries never deleted
- **Browser instances**: May not close properly on errors

### Low
- **No TypeScript validation**: Some types not fully enforced
- **Inconsistent error messages**: Error UX could be better
- **No loading indicators**: Some operations lack user feedback
- **CSS consistency**: Some components use inline styles

---

## üîß Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **Database migration**: Move from in-memory to persistent storage
2. **Error handling**: Standardize error handling across modules
3. **Input validation**: Add comprehensive validation
4. **Type safety**: Improve TypeScript coverage

### Medium Priority
1. **Code organization**: Refactor large files
2. **Dependency management**: Update outdated packages
3. **CSS refactoring**: Consolidate utility classes
4. **Component splitting**: Break down large components

### Low Priority
1. **Code comments**: Add JSDoc comments
2. **Naming consistency**: Standardize naming conventions
3. **Dead code removal**: Remove unused components/utils
4. **Performance optimization**: Optimize re-renders

---

## üìä Metrics

### Code Statistics (Approximate)
- **Total Files**: ~100
- **Lines of Code**: ~8,000
- **Components**: 15+
- **Pages**: 10+
- **API Endpoints**: 8
- **Modules**: 3 custom modules

### Test Coverage
- **Current**: < 5% (minimal testing)
- **Target**: 80%+ for critical paths

### Performance
- **Average scrape time**: 3-8 seconds
- **RSS feed processing**: 10-30 seconds (depends on items)
- **Page load time**: < 2 seconds
- **Build time**: ~10 seconds (development)

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions

**Why in-memory storage?**
- Fast prototyping
- No initial database setup
- Easy to replace later
- Good for MVP

**Why Nuxt 3?**
- Full-stack framework
- Great DX with auto-imports
- Module system for extensibility
- Future SSR capability

**Why Supabase?**
- Managed PostgreSQL
- Built-in storage
- Good free tier
- Simple API

### Future Considerations

**Scaling Strategy**:
- Current: Single server, in-memory state
- Short-term: Database + single server
- Long-term: Distributed system with queue

**Deployment Options**:
- Vercel (easiest for Nuxt)
- Self-hosted (more control)
- Edge deployment (future)
